# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Overview
This project demonstrates how to predict the likelihood of loan approval for individuals or organizations based on their financial records and various other attributes. The dataset used contains details such as credit score, income, employment status, loan amount, assets value, and loan term. We will use machine learning algorithms to build a model capable of predicting loan approval decisions.

The dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis for classification tasks and is ideal for testing algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and other classification techniques.

Requirements
Python version: 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a loan will be approved or denied based on the applicant's financial data using machine learning classification models. This will help lenders make more informed and automated loan approval decisions.
